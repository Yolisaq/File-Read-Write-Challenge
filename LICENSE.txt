### üêç Step 2: Create the Python Script (`file_read_write.py`)

In your repository, create a Python file named `file_read_write.py` with the following content:

```python
def modify_file_content(input_file, output_file):
    try:
        with open(input_file, 'r') as f:
            content = f.read()
        
        # Example modification: convert all text to uppercase
        modified_content = content.upper()

        with open(output_file, 'w') as f:
            f.write(modified_content)
        
        print(f"File has been modified and saved as '{output_file}'.")

    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"Error: The file '{input_file}' does not exist.")
    except PermissionError:
        print(f"Error: You don't have permission to read/write '{input_file}' or '{output_file}'.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")

# Ask the user for input
input_file = input("Enter the filename to read: ")
output_file = input("Enter the filename to save the modified content: ")

modify_file_content(input_file, output_file)
